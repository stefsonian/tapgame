1 The time left before the target disappears is shown by the target border shrinking
(starting at 360 degrees and ending at 0 degrees). At 0 degrees the target is gone.
We could also let the target start to fade away into the background until it's gone.

2 The target appears on the screen and at the same time a 'hole' appears somewhere
else on the screen (say, twice the size of the target) and immediately starts shrinking.
The player must drag the target and 'drop it into the hole' before the hole becomes
too small to fit the target.
- Could be expanded with multiple holes shrinking at different rates and with
different colours (holes of a certain colour shrink faster and give more points)
- Cold be expanded by letting the target grow and shrink in size such that
the player can opt to wait for the target to shrink enough to fit in the hole
(but risk the hole shrinking faster or the target growing too big for the hole).
